# MOAReduction (Data reduction on MOA)

MOAReduction is an extension for MOA, which allows to perform data reduction on data streams (w/o drift). It includes several reduction methods for different reduction tasks, such as: discretization, instance selection, and feature selection. The complete list of methods is described below:

Discretization:

* "Discretization from data streams: Applications to histograms and data mining", Joao Gama et al. (PiD)
* "Online ChiMerge Algorithm"	Petri Lehtinen et al. (OC)
* "Incremental Discretization for Naïve-Bayes Classifier", Jingli Lui et al. (IFFD)

Instance Selection:

* "A concept drift-tolerant case-base editing technique	NEFCS-SRR",	N. Lu et al. (NEFCS-SRR)
* "An analysis of case-base editing in a spam filtering system", Delany et al. (CBE)
* "Advances in instance selection for instance-based learning algorithms", H. Brighton et al. (ICF)
* "Combining similarity in time and space for training set formation under concept drift", I. Žliobaité et al. (FISH)
* "Incremental learning of concept drift in nonstationary environments"	R. Elwell et al. (Learn++.NSE)

Feature Selection:

* "On the Utility of Incremental Feature Selection for the Classification of Textual Data Streams", Katakis et al.
* "Heterogeneous Ensemble for Feature Drifts in Data Streams", Nguyen et al. (FCBF)
* "Online feature selection and its Applications", Wang et al. (OFS)
